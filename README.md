# Haiku Checker

## Authors: Nate McGregor, Karla Buckner

### _This program allows users to enter each line of a haiku poem. Each line of a haiku should have a certain amount of syllables. The first line requires five syllables, the second seven, and the third five. Once a poem is entered the program will indicate to the user if the poem they entered is indeed a valid haiku, if it is not it will indicate that more syllables are required and how many syllables they have entered._
